Great question! In Azure Pipelines (and CI/CD in general), **artifacts** are files or packages that are generated during a build and are **saved, published, and shared** between stages or pipelines.

---

### âœ… **What Are Artifacts in Azure Pipelines?**

> **Artifacts = Output of a pipeline stage** (like `.zip`, `.nupkg`, `.dll`, `.jar`, etc.)

They can be:
- Build outputs (like compiled binaries)
- Test reports
- Deployment packages (like a web app .zip or Docker image tag)
- Custom files needed by later pipeline stages

---

### ðŸ“¦ **Example Use Case:**

#### 1. **Build Stage:**
```yaml
- task: DotNetCoreCLI@2
  inputs:
    command: 'publish'
    publishWebProjects: true
    arguments: '--configuration Release --output $(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)'
```

#### 2. **Publish Artifacts:**
```yaml
- task: PublishBuildArtifacts@1
  inputs:
    PathtoPublish: '$(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)'
    ArtifactName: 'drop'
    publishLocation: 'Container'
```

> This creates and stores a build artifact named `drop`.

#### 3. **Deploy Stage (Later or Another Pipeline):**
```yaml
- download: current
  artifact: drop

- script: unzip drop/mywebapp.zip && deploy it...
```

---

### ðŸ§  Think of it like:
1. **Build something**
2. **Package the output**
3. **Save it as an artifact**
4. **Download it in a later stage for testing or deployment**

Would you like an end-to-end YAML pipeline flow with artifacts across **build â†’ test â†’ deploy**?
